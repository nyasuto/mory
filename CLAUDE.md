## Important Reminders
- Focus on requested functionality only
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones  
- Only create documentation when explicitly requested
- **Japanese Localization**: All documentation (README.md, QUICKSTART.md, API.md) has been rewritten in Japanese for better accessibility to Japanese users. Maintain this localization in future updates.
